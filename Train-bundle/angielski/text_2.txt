Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609,[12] having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.[13][14][15][5]: 53  Kepler's third law was published in 1619.[16][14] Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the Solar System, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit – Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury.[17] His first law reflected this discovery.

In 1621, Kepler noted that his third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter.[Nb 1] Godefroy Wendelin also made this observation in 1643.[Nb 2] The second law, in the "area law" form, was contested by Nicolaus Mercator in a book from 1664, but by 1670 his Philosophical Transactions were in its favour.[18][19] As the century proceeded it became more widely accepted.[20] The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's Principia was published and was taken to be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of Gottfried Leibniz on Kepler had been published.[21]

Newton was credited with understanding that the second law is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial nature of that law, whereas the other laws do depend on the inverse square form of the attraction. Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz much later identified a symmetry principle in the phase space of planetary motion (the orthogonal group O(4) acting) which accounts for the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian gravitation, as conservation of angular momentum does via rotational symmetry for the second law.[22]
